# Information_Retrieval

Information retrieval project  based on the TREC Clinical Trials Challenge dataset. ElasticSearch was used to create an interactive search engine to match suitable pateints to clinical trials. 
A subset of the TREC Clinical trials dataset was used due to size limitations. Performance metrics were filtered based only on available patients/ trials to account for the lack of complete dataset.
The keyword extraction transformer KeyBERT was used as part of one experiment to assess its performance on verbose queries.
